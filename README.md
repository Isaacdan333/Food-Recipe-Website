# Food-Recipe-Website
Our website is an exciting food website dedicated to helping college students discover, prepare, and enjoy delicious meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Here you will find the source code for our project!


# Features
You will find the homepage source and then a folder for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
There will be a link for each recipe and you will find how we designed and made each recipe.
There will also be a page for sources we found for that recipe. As we are CS students not cooking students,
we intend to credit the people that we got the idea from.

# Updates
Here you can find when we updated and added new features for this project.
